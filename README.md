# UltimateIVCalculator

Welcome!

This is my IV calculator that utilizes PokeAPI to calculate your IV's on your pokemon for all generations 1-9!

It's a python GUI using Tkinter that works on the latest version of python.

Currently this build is in its very early stages so expect mediocrity when it comes to the look of the GUI right now and lack of validations if you dont enter a pokemon or nature.

I plan to make this a fully functional application that doesn't require command prompt or an IDE to run it, but for now please enjoy the first release!
