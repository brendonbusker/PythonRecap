# UltimateIVCalculator

Welcome!

This is my IV calculator that utilizes PokeAPI to calculate your IV's on your pokemon for all generations 1-9!

It's a python GUI developed using CustomTkinter. Please go check out the creator's page! https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter

Also a big shoutout to PokeAPI.co! Without them this project would not be possible.

I still plan to update this more in the future, but for now it is semi-functional.

For best accuracy I would only really trust this tool's efficacy if your pokemon is about level 70+, as I don't have the calculator giving out an IV range right now.

You'll find the .exe file at dist/main/main.exe (I'll rename it from main.exe to UltimateIVCalculator.exe in the next update)

***Do not move main.exe from dist or it will not run, create a shortcut instead if you want to move it***

Regardless, I'm quite proud of my progress and I hope to keep updating this more!
